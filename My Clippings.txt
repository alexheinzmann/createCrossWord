Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home (Nando Parrado)

And as I pondered his words, I saw the error I was making. I had been thinking of the disaster as a horrible mistake, as an unscripted deviation from the happy story of the life I had been promised. But now I began to understand that my ordeal in the Andes was not an interruption of my true destiny, or a perversion of what my life was supposed to be. It simply was my life, and the future that lay ahead was the only future available to me. To hide from this fact, or to live in bitterness and anger, would only keep me from living any genuine life at all.

Before the crash, I took so much for granted, but the mountains showed me that life, any life, is a miracle. Now, miraculously, I had been granted a second chance to live. It was not the life I wanted or expected, but I understood that it was my duty now to live that life as richly and as hopefully as I could. I vowed to try. I would live with passion and curiosity. I would open myself to the possibilities of life. I would savor every moment, and I would try, every day, to become more human and more alive. To do any less, I understood, would be an insult to those who hadn’t survived.

why do they always teach us that it’s easy and evil to do what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? It’s the hardest thing in the world—to do what we want. And it takes the greatest kind of courage. I mean, what we really want. As I wanted to marry you. Not as I want to sleep with some woman or get drunk or get my name in the papers. Those things—they’re not even desires—they’re things people do to escape from desires—because it’s such a big responsibility, really to want something.”

Here are some that I’ve used productively and strongly recommend:* • Read The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss (free at the library!); it has excellent practical information on stretching your resources. • Check out Lifehacker.com. The blog has tons of tips and tricks for increasing your productivity. • Read Seth Godin’s blog, www.sethgodin.typepad.com. One of my marketing mentors, Seth is full of innovative ideas for using new media and other accessible, guerrilla techniques for marketing your work. • Boost your serendipity by using Twitter. When it comes to getting a job or discovering new things, you might be surprised to learn how much you can gain by following friends of friends on Twitter. Our immediate friends already go to the same parties we do, know the same people, and listen to the same music. Not so with our weaker links (friends of friends of friends), who can turn us on to new things. • Compete (www.compete.com) and Quantcast (www.quantcast.com) can tell you how many monthly visitors your competitors’ websites are getting and the search terms that are generating the most traffic for them. If you know what’s working for your competitors, you can make it work for you too. • Similarly, SpyFu (www.spyfu.com) can help you find out competitors’ online advertising spending, plus keyword and ad-word details. If their strategies are working, it’s likely they’ll work for you too. • Book trips through Kayak (www.kayak.com), the easiest site on which to find and buy plane tickets, car rentals, and hotel reservations. Kayak aggregates other travel search engines like Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com, saving you both time and money. Another great new site in this space: www.hipmunk.com. • Do Doodle (www.doodle.com): This is a great tool for setting up meetings with multiple people who have busy schedules. Send a link with proposed times and dates to the people you need to meet; check back later and Doodle will tell you the ones that work for the most people. • Check out Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org), a digital library of more than 30,000 free eBooks to read on your computer or PDA. • Tap LibriVox (www.librivox.org), which lets you listen to thousands of audiobooks for free. • Look into iStockphoto (www.istockphoto.com), the Net’s largest source of royalty-free photos, vector illustrations, videos, and Flash files. • View Footage Firm (www.footagefirm.com), a great source of free and low-cost royalty-free stock video footage. • With FreeConferenceCall.com, you can get a free, personalized conference-call number. The service offers inexpensive international numbers as well. • Try LegalZoom (www.legalzoom.com), an inexpensive resource providing documents for company formation, trademarks, patents, copyrights, and other legal issues. • Access Weebly (www.weebly.com), a platform similar to WordPress that allows you to quickly and easily create websites, even if you have no HTML experience. • Participate at 99designs (www.99designs.com), which provides a very inexpensive way to get logos, business cards, and websites designed. The service is based on a contest system in which you fill out a simple form about what you’re looking to design (e.g., “I want to create a logo for my company, with XYZ specifications”) and set a budget for what you’re willing to pay. Designers from around the world then submit concepts based on your requirements. As designs are being submitted, you rate the ones that you like the best and give feedback on how the designs can be improved. After a set amount of time (usually seven days), you choose the winning design and pay the designer the prize amount. THE CHELSEA INN Whenever I have to spend a night in New York City, I stay at what I call the Chelsea Inn. This is my friend Rachel Shechtman’s couch in her Manhattan apartment. Over the years, the Chelsea Inn has saved the company tens of thousands of dollars—and it lets me reconnect with a good friend as well.

But did I have a responsibility to have a family? Oh, Lord—responsibility. That word worked on me until I worked on it, until I looked at it carefully and broke it down into the two words that make its true definition: the ability to respond. And what I ultimately had to respond to was the reality that every speck of my being was telling me to get out of my marriage. Somewhere inside me an early-warning system was forecasting that if I kept trying to white-knuckle my way through this storm, I would end up getting cancer. And that if I brought children into the world anyway, just because I didn’t want to deal with the hassle or shame of revealing some impractical facts about myself—this would be an act of grievous irresponsibility.
